#### **Week 2: Core Trading Logic Implementation**
**Objectives:** Implement the 5% take-profit, 1% stop-loss strategy  

**Tasks:**
- **Algorithm Architecture**
```python
class MomentumTradingAlgorithm(QCAlgorithm):
    def Initialize(self):
        self.take_profit_pct = 0.05
        self.stop_loss_pct = 0.01
        self.max_positions = 10
        self.position_size = 0.1  # 10% of portfolio per position

### Entry Logic Implementation
- Define stock universe (e.g., QQQ components or custom watchlist)
- Implement momentum-based entry signals
- Add position sizing logic with max 10% per stock
- Limit concurrent positions to 10

### Exit Logic Implementation
- Monitor for 5% profit target
- Implement 1% stop-loss
- Add time-based exit rules if needed
- Handle partial fills and slippage

### Risk Management
- Daily max loss limit ($500)
- Portfolio heat checks before new positions
- Market hours validation
- Emergency liquidation procedures

### Deliverables
- Complete algorithm with entry/exit logic
- Risk management framework
- Initial backtesting results

## 🏗 Technical Architecture

```python
class SmartTradingBot(QCAlgorithm):
    def Initialize(self):
        self.SetStartDate(2022, 1, 1)
        self.SetCash(100000)
        self.take_profit = 0.05
        self.stop_loss = 0.01
        self.max_positions = 10
        
        self.AddEquity("SPY", Resolution.Minute)
        self.UniverseSettings.Resolution = Resolution.Daily
        
        self.Schedule.On(
            self.DateRules.EveryDay("SPY"),
            self.TimeRules.AfterMarketOpen("SPY", 30),
            self.RebalancePortfolio
        )
    
    def OnData(self, data):
        for symbol, holding in self.Portfolio.items():
            if holding.Invested:
                self.CheckExitConditions(symbol, holding)
    
    def RebalancePortfolio(self):
        pass
    
    def CheckExitConditions(self, symbol, holding):
        pass
```
